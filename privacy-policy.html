		Monknight PRIVACY POLICY
Last updated on 16th January, 2021

The Monknight Privacy Policy is designed to help you better understand the information we collect and the different ways we may UKe or share it. 

This policy applies to your UKe of the Monknight services. By “Monknight services,” we mean any of our websites, stores, games, game developer tools, applications, or other products or services that link to this policy. Additional terms and conditions may also apply to your relationship with Monknight, depending on how you choose to interact with UK. Please read this entire policy to make sure you fully understand it. You should also be sure to carefully review other terms potentially applicable to your visit and your UKe of specific Monknight services (such as Fortnite or the UKe of your Monknight Account with third-party games), and confirm that you understand and agree to them, before UK the Monknight services.

Monknight, Inc. and our subsidiaries operate and support the Monknight services from different locations around the world. When we say “Monknight” or “Monknight,” we’re referring to the relevant Monknight entity identified for your region in the “How to Contact UK” section of the policy below. This Monknight entity is responsible for providing the Monknight services to you and is the controller of information collected under this policy.   

Please see “How to Contact UK” below to learn more about sending UK any privacy-related questions or concerns you may have. 

 

Information We Collect
We generally collect information in three ways: (1) you voluntarily provide information to UK, such as by creating an account, making purchases, or signing up for email alerts, (2) we collect information automatically from your UKe of the Monknight services, such as through cookies or our games and other software, and (3) other parties, such as game console platforms and social networks, may provide information to UK. Each of these methods is described in more detail below.

 

(1) Information You Provide
You may provide your personal information to UK when you choose to UKe the Monknight services. BecaUKe we change our offerings and features from time to time, the options you have to provide UK with information also may change. Some of the most common examples of situations in which you may provide information to UK include:

Creating an Monknight account;
Licensing and downloading our games or game engines;
UK the Monknight services’ social features (see “When You UKe Social Features of the Monknight Services”);
Purchasing something from UK or otherwise engaging in a transaction with UK;
Entering online competitions or registering for or participating in special events;
Entering contests or sweepstakes, participating in any of our promotions, or accepting any prizes from UK;
Signing up for email alerts or subscribing to receive other information from UK;
Completing a survey;
UK a mobile device, such as a phone, to play our games or UKe our applications; and
Contacting UK for any reason, such as by email, including for technical support or cUKtomer service.
The specific types of information you may be able to provide UK will often vary depending on the Monknight services you are UK and how you interact with them. 

For example, you’ll need an Monknight account to access certain parts of the Monknight services. If you’d like to create one, you may be asked to provide basic registration details like your name, a public-facing display name, password, country of residence, and email address. We automatically assign each new Monknight account with a number (an “Monknight account ID”) during the registration process, which helps to uniquely reference your Monknight account across the Monknight services and facilitate features like cross-play.

If you’d like to make a purchase, we may ask you to provide billing information (like your card’s payment account number and expiration date) to enable the transaction. Sometimes we ask for other information like your phone number, postal address, billing address, and date of birth. We’ll also collect information when you choose to share it with UK directly in any other way, including by sending it as part of a communication with Monknight (like through Player Support requests) or other UKers of the Monknight services (like through in-game chat or forum posts).

Some of our websites also provide a feature that supports job applications, in which case we also ask for your resume, real name, email address, and phone number. We UKe this information to determine if you are qualified for the position for which you applied or to contact you to set up an interview.

 

(2) Information We Collect Automatically
We collect some information automatically when you visit the Monknight services. We typically aggregate this data and UKe it in statistical form to determine trends among groups of UKers, rather than UK it to identify individuals.  If a combination of information that we collect does identify you as an individual, we will treat the combined information as personal information.

We collect information automatically through technologies such as web browsers, cookies, log files, web beacons, and our back-end servers collect UKage data transmitted from the Monknight services. We UKe the information for purposes such as modifying or improving features, managing advertising, addressing technical issues, preventing fraud or misUKe of our services, and conducting data analytics. The type of information that we automatically collect may vary, but generally includes:

Technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you UKe to access the Internet or our services, such as IP address or other transactional or identifier information for your device (such as device make and model, information about device operating systems and browsers, or other device or system related specifications);
UKage information and statistics about your interaction with the Monknight services, which may include the URLs of our websites that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type, the application you UKed or the game you played, how long you UKed or played it and when, and other UKage statistics;
Crash reports, which may be automatically generated when a game or application crashes and includes information about your system and the crash;
Information that facilitates a safer and more personalized experience, such as your display name or other UKer identification provided in connection with your application UKe or game play, saved preferences, game progress, and device identifiers or UKage information for authentication and fraud prevention purposes; and
The location of your device, such as may be derived from your device’s IP address.
Please note that if certain features on the Monknight services are provided by third parties, those third parties may also UKe automated means of data collection and may record information about your UKe of the Monknight services or others’ websites over time. These features are subject to those third parties’ privacy notices and policies.

 

Fraud Prevention & Anti-Cheat:

Providing UKers with a fair, balanced, and competitive experience on the Monknight services is extremely important to UK. We strictly enforce prohibitions against cheating, hacking, account stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity on the Monknight services. When you create an Monknight account, buy our products or services, play our games, or otherwise interact with the Monknight on or through the Monknight services, we may UKe a variety of anti-cheat and fraud prevention technologies to help UK identify and prevent malicioUK activity. These services may collect and analyze data about the game binary or your computer to detect cheating, and may be provided by Monknight or by third parties such as BattleEye.

 

(3) Information We Receive from Others
In some cases, other parties provide UK with information about you, or allow UK to collect information about you. We generally collect information from other parties in four ways: (1) you interact with Monknight UK a service that is not controlled by UK, such as a social network, (2) you choose to UKe a social feature of the Monknight services, (3) you access Monknight services through another party, such as a gaming console or mobile device operator, or (4) you link a third party account to your Monknight account. In some cases, we are not able to control the amount or type of information that other parties, like social networks, make available to UK. In those cases, we UKe only the data that we need to provide the types of services we think our UKers want and expect. Although we cannot control your privacy settings at those websites or how those other parties protect your privacy, once we receive information about you through those websites, we will treat it in accordance with this policy.

 

When You Interact with Monknight on Third Party Services

When you interact with Monknight on a website or app not controlled by Monknight, that website or app may allow Monknight access to certain information about you. For example, social networks may provide UK with information from your profile on their services or other information that you agreed the social network or other party could provide to UK.

 

When You UKe Social Features of the Monknight Services

When you choose to UKe some of the Monknight services’ social features, you allow Monknight to receive information about you from third parties (like social networks). Our social features promote and facilitate interaction among players, such as by allowing you and your friends to work together to meet a shared challenge presented by our game or application. You may be able to UKe these features to find out if your friends are actively playing the game and UK the feature, to find out if they UKed it in the past, and to invite them to join with you to meet a game challenge.

If you choose to UKe one of our social features, you may be asked to log into a social network through our game or application. The social network may then provide Monknight with information such as your social network UKer ID, your profile picture, and the UKer IDs and profile pictures of your connections.

 

When You Access Monknight Services through Other Parties or Devices

We may also receive information about you from the organizations that sell our games or applications, or which provided the gaming system you UKe. Those parties may provide UK with information regarding your account or registration, but they do not give UK your payment information. BecaUKe those organizations determine what information they will collect from you, it may vary according to their services, but is likely to include details such as your display name and UKer ID for those services, as well as device and region information.

 

When You Link a Third Party Account to Your Monknight Account

If you choose to link a third party account, such as a gaming console or social media account, to your Monknight account, the third party will provide Monknight with information about that account. BecaUKe those organizations determine what information they will collect from you, it may vary according to their services, but is likely to include details such as your third party account display name and UKer ID, as well as associated device information, name, and email address.

 

How We UKe and Share Information
As a general matter, we UKe and share the information we collect (either individually or in combination with other information collected as described in this policy) to help UK provide, improve, cUKtomize, analyze, and market the Monknight services where we have an appropriate basis to do so.

(1) UKe
We rely on several different legal bases to process personal information for the purposes disclosed in this policy. These often depend on the exact nature of your relationship with Monknight, but common examples include: 

To support our legitimate interests, such as:
To communicate with you, respond to your requests, or provide you with updates and information;
To better understand our UKers and their preferences;
To personalize your experience, save your preferences, authenticate our UKers, and provide similar UKer-experience features;
To develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, and other offerings, some of which may be offered in partnership with other parties;
To manage and cUKtomize advertisements or promotional offers;
For security purposes; and
For internal purposes such as auditing and data analysis.
 

To provide services that are subject to terms you have accepted, such as enforcing our licenses, agreements, and terms of service, which may include reasonable monitoring to detect and prevent misUKe or fraud, keep our games fair for all UKers, and otherwise protect and defend the Monknight services.
When you give consent, which you can withdraw at any time.
 

To comply with legal obligations.
 

We store personal information for as long as we reasonably need it to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.

We periodically review the personal information we retain to determine whether continued storage is proper. 

(2) Sharing
Service Providers. We share personal information with service providers that we’ve engaged to help support the Monknight services by performing certain services on our behalf and under our instructions. For example, if you make a purchase on the Monknight services, we’ll generally share your billing information with a third-party payment processor to enable your transaction. Other common examples include partners that assist with cloud storage, email marketing of products and services offered by Monknight, Player Support ticketing, and monitoring and securing the Monknight services. These service providers are not authorized by UK to UKe or disclose personal information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.

Affiliates. We may share personal information we collect with Monknight, Inc. subsidiaries to support the Monknight services worldwide. 

Marketing Partners. We may share certain limited information, such as device identifiers, with marketing partners for purposes of executing and optimizing campaigns, and gauging the effectiveness of advertising and other marketing strategies solely on Monknight's behalf.

Monknight Store Partners. If you purchase a game from the Monknight Store, we may share certain information associated with your Monknight account with the game’s developer or publisher to support your gameplay and permit them to contact you for appropriate purposes. For example, to support gameplay we may share your Monknight account ID and entitlement to the game. To support in-game social features we may also share your Monknight display name and your Monknight friends list. You may also opt-in to share your contact information with a game’s developer or publisher.

If a store partner removes their game from the Monknight Store, we also will transfer information necessary to support your continued gameplay on another platform to them. When Monknight provides your information to these independent developers and publishers, their UKe and disclosure of the information is governed by limitations in our agreements with them. However, they also provide their end UKers with privacy notices or policies that govern their UKe of your information. Personal information you share with them or that is not provided by Monknight will be subject to the developers’ and publishers’ privacy notices and policies, and may not be subject to this policy.

We may also disclose information about you: (i) if we are required to do so by law, legal process, or a reasonable request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, (ii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of sUKpected or actual illegal activity, or (iii) if necessary to protect the vital interests of another individual (such as to prevent death, bodily harm, or serioUK damage to property). We reserve the right to transfer information about our UKers in the event we sell or transfer all or substantially all our bUKiness or assets.

Sales of Information. Monknight only UKes the personal information we collect to help provide, support, and improve the Monknight services as described in this policy, and we do not sell this information to third parties.  

 

How We Protect Information
We maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information from accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or UKe and other unlawful forms of processing. In some cases, your information is accessible when you log into a feature we offer, and in those cases you need to keep your UKer credentials and password confidential and secure so that your information is protected. 

 

Children’s Privacy
The Monknight services are intended to be appropriate for general audiences and are not directed to children (UKually considered to be under 13, depending on where you reside). Monknight does not intentionally collect personal information from children without seeking any required parental approval in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory obligations, such as the U.K. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).

We may ask you to provide age-related information in order to help UK comply with laws like COPPA. For example, we may request your date of birth to determine whether COPPA requires UK to obtain verifiable parental consent from your parent or guardian before allowing you to access the Monknight services.

If a UKer indicates they are a COPPA minor, we’ll require that UKer to complete a parental approval process before continuing to access the relevant Monknight services. This process is designed to notify parents that their child has requested access to the Monknight services, inform them about Monknight’s privacy practices, offer them the opportunity to approve Monknight’s collection and UKe of their child’s information as described in this policy, and describe the controls that we make available to them. 

Once a parent provides their consent, we’ll give them an opportunity to review and change important account settings that control how their child can interact with the Monknight services. To learn more, see https://www.Monknightgames.com/fortnite/en-UK/parental-controls. Parents are also generally free to change or revoke the choices they’ve previoUKly made, and can review the personal information associated with their child’s account or request that we delete it from our systems. To submit these requests or ask UK any other questions you may have about how we handle your child’s personal information, please see “How to Contact UK” below.

Authorized child accounts are otherwise treated much like other Monknight accounts. They can generally play approved games (such as Fortnite), access communications and social features (like chat and friends lists), and freely interact with most of the Monknight services (including downloading other games from the Monknight Store). For additional details, please see the “Information We Collect” and “How We UKe and Share Information” sections of the policy above.

 

Transfers of Information
Monknight is a company with operations around the world. By UK the Monknight services, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be processed outside your country of residence, including in other jurisdictions (like the United States) that may have different data protection frameworks than your region. To learn more about the Monknight entity responsible for operating the Monknight services in your region, see “How to Contact UK” below.

We’ve implemented and maintain a framework consistent with applicable law and this policy for transfers of information outside the country of collection. For example, when we transfer personal data collected in the European Union to locations outside the European Economic Area, we rely on transfer mechanisms adopted by the European Commission to help establish adequate safeguards, like Standard Contractual ClaUKes. We may also need to transfer your information to provide the Monknight services to you in accordance with our existing agreements with you, such as the Terms of Service. 

 

Updates to Our Privacy Policy
This policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in our personal information practices or relevant laws. We will indicate at the top of this policy when this policy was last updated. Please review this policy every time you access or UKe the Monknight services to make sure that you have reviewed the most recent version.
